# logograms

a place where I waste time trying to make art

For the record, this is [Alistair Rushworth’s
fault](https://twitter.com/rushworth_a/status/1466116259116953604)

The way I see it on first impressions is that: - There should be a
logogram function that takes a morpheme input - As a function of this
input it should generate: - The ring shape - The decoration
(i.e. whatever gets added to the underlying ring)

The input morpheme should affect: - the length of the ring - any
perturbations of the ring (i.e. the function that defines the line
shape, the thickness) - The type of the decoration

Rules: - The decorations should stay on the ring

At present this does nothing.
